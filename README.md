# UPI-Transactions-Dashboard

This project involves building an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transaction data. The goal is to explore transaction trends, demographic insights, and provide interactive visualizations to enhance data understanding.

## Project Overview

This Power BI project includes:

- Loading and profiling UPI transaction data.
- Creating slicers for dynamic filtering by parameters like age group and transaction pages.
- Adding line charts and matrix visuals for trend and detailed analysis.
- Applying conditional formatting and syncing slicers across visuals.
- Designing bookmarks for navigation and focused insights.
- Publishing the final report to Power BI Service.

## Dataset

### Source

The dataset used in this project is provided as:

- **File Name:** `UPI Transactions.xlsx`

### Dataset Structure

The dataset contains information related to UPI transactions, including:

- **Transaction ID:** Unique identifier for each transaction.
